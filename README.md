Its does'nt really matter who goes first, whether `X` or `O`

`TicTacToe` involves thinking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

If you always pay attention and think ahead, you'll never lose a game of TicTacToe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.

### Rules For `TicTacToe` :robot:
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

- You are `X`, your friend (or the computer in this case) is `O`. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

- The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

### Fun Facts :apple:

A `combinatorics` study of the game shows that when "X" makes the first move every time, the game outcomes are as follows:

- 91 distinct positions are won by (X)
- 44 distinct positions are won by (O)
- 3 distinct positions are drawn (often called a "cat's game"[15])
